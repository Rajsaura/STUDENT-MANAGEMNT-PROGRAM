**Student Performance Analysis System**

A Python-based console application to manage student records and analyze academic performance using data analysis and visualization.

📌 **Project Overview**
This project works with student marks data (Physics, Chemistry, Maths) to:
- Store and manage student records
- Analyze overall class performance
- Visualize individual student performance
- Determine pass/fail status based on average marks

The project focuses on clear logic, structured code, and meaningful visual insights.

✨ **Features**
Add, view, search, and edit student records
Class-level performance analysis:
  ~ Mean and median marks
  ~ Overall pass/fail count
Individual student performance visualization:
  ~ Subject-wise bar chart
  ~ Summary table with marks, average, and result
Pass/Fail decision using conditional logic

🛠️ **Tech Stack**
- Language: Python  
- Libraries: pandas, matplotlib  
- Data Storage: CSV file  
- Interface:Console-based (menu-driven)

📈 **Future Scope**
- Implement machine learning models for academic performance prediction
- develop ui/ux
